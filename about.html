<h2> This photo collection aims to establish a sense of entrance and funneling into a utopian space. Starting with images of atmosphere,
  that then moves into interior and surroundings and finally narrowing down to very close up photos of texture and materiality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The layout of the website is simple and clean, complete focus is placed on the photographs and a calm experience is created with
  simplistic type which reads guiding actions to navigate through the photographs.

<br>
<br>
And in the last option, once the viewer decides to 'stay' they are redirected to a page where all the photos merge and fade in and out as you zoom out
of what you just entered, so the images are going backwards in the order of zooming out. Accompanied with mellow music for a calming tone.
